## Organization & It's Members

The organization is divided into two categories:

- Organization
- Department

The "Organization" represents an independent entity in real
life, so "Organization" is the top level among our extension.

Organizations can only set up departments, departments can
also open subordinate departments.

Organization and their subordinate departments will contain
several members, of which there are creator and administrators.

The creator (or the founder), as the name suggests, is the
person who created the organization or department.
This identity is fixed throughout the organization or
department's life cycle, and can not be transferred to other
members.
Therefore, there is only one creator in organization or
department.

The administrator has all permissions within the
organization or department, except to assign, revoke
administrator role and revoke his organization or department.
The administrator can be more than one, it's identity is not
fixed.

Only the creator can give and revoke the administrator, but
only if the user must be a member of the current organization
or department.

Creator and administrator can add and remove members, but the
administrator can not remove other administrators from the
organization or department.
